baf - example packaging layout
==============================

baf is an example python packaging layout
by `@kvbik <https://twitter.com/kvbik>`_

i've read multiple ``setup.py`` files, blogposts and articles,
spoken to multiple people, deployed multiple packages

and i want to share a packaging layout that i come up with

it'll get change in the future i think as my preference
(and python packaging folk as well) get changed.
you can discuss features of course or even send pull requests..
